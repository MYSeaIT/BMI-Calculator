# Body Mass Index Calculator Project

## Introduction
This project is a Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculator web application. It allows users to input their age, height, weight, and gender to calculate their BMI and get an assessment of their weight category.

## Development Process
- Started by creating the index.html file with the necessary structure and form inputs.
- Developed the script.js file to handle form validation and BMI calculation.
- Encountered errors related to form validation and event listeners.
- Resolved the errors by adjusting the event listener implementations and form validation logic.
- Tested the application and made further refinements to ensure accurate BMI calculation and result display.

## Encountered Errors and Solutions
1. Error: Form submission not triggering the BMI calculation function.
   - Solution: Added event listeners to validate the form and calculate BMI upon submission.

2. Error: Event listeners not properly removing after form submission.
   - Solution: Adjusted the event listener removal logic to ensure it works as intended.

3. Error: Inaccurate BMI calculation and weight category assessment.
   - Solution: Refactored the BMI calculation and result assessment logic to accurately reflect weight categories.

## How to Run the Project
To run the project, simply open the index.html file in a web browser. Fill in the required details and click the "Submit" button to see the BMI calculation and weight category assessment.
